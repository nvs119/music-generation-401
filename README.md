# music-generation-401

Final Project for COS 401, Introduction to Machine Translation, Spring 2022.

In this project, we aim to treat music generation as a translation problem, familiarize ourselves with some classic NLP machine learning models accordingly, incorporate some domain knowledge to reduce the dimensionality of our input data, and study the strengths and weaknesses of our various models in accomplishing this task.
